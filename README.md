# Java Database

## Overview
In this project, I created a small database in Java programming language.

## How it works
Basically, all you need is to decide the number of people you want to input. Next, program asks to write their names and later an emails.

## What was used
In order to run the program. I used several arrays and "for" loops. I transfered the inputs to new arrays in order to correct spelling (Lower cases for e-mails, Upper cases for names)

## Future plans
In the future, I will hopefully update and improve this program adding some more cool features and use GUI.
